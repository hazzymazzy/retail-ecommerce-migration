# ðŸ›’ Retail E-Commerce Migration (AWS Cloud Project)

**Project:** Retail Static Website Cloud Deployment using AWS & Terraform  
**Team:** Hardik, Andrea, Daniel, Joseph â€“ 2025 CCA UG (Group 1)  
**Instructor:** Essam  
**Unit:** Cloud Computing Architecting (AWS Academy)

---

This project deploys a **static retail website** to **Amazon S3** and delivers it globally via **CloudFront CDN**, fully provisioned using **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)**.

âœ… **Single-file Terraform deployment (`main.tf`)** â€” easy for assessment and reproducibility  
âœ… **No manual AWS Console configuration** â€” full IaC automation  
âœ… **Live CloudFront URL generated automatically on deploy** â€” ready for showcase  
âœ… Aligned with AWS Well-Architected principles: **Security, Cost Efficiency, Performance, Reliability, and Operational Excellence**

## Live Demo (Team Deployment Instance)

CloudFront URL: **https://d1gd53n8lrwf08.cloudfront.net**

> â„¹ **Note:** This URL was generated from our team deployment.  
> When `terraform apply` is executed in the AWS Academy Sandbox, **a new CloudFront URL will be generated automatically**.  
> This tracking is for **logging and demonstration purposes only.**.

## Deployment Instructions (AWS Academy Sandbox)
0. Clone the Repository (Get the Code)

Cloning ensures you are working with the latest Terraform and website files.

Option A â€” HTTPS

git clone https://github.com/hazzymazzy/retail-ecommerce-migration.git
cd retail-ecommerce-migration/terraform


Option B â€” SSH (optional, only if GitHub SSH keys are set up)

git clone git@github.com:hazzymazzy/retail-ecommerce-migration.git
cd retail-ecommerce-migration/terraform


Note: SSH is only needed for pushing changes back to GitHub.
For assessment, only terraform apply is required â€” SSH is not needed.

(Optional for CloudShell users) Set AWS Region
export AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2


Ensures deployment happens in the correct AWS Academy Sandbox region (Sydney).

(Only if Terraform is not installed) Install Terraform
sudo yum -y install yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform

# Verify installation:
terraform -version


This step is required only once per CloudShell session if Terraform is not available.

1. Initialise and Deploy
terraform init


Downloads AWS providers and prepares the working directory.

terraform plan -out=tfplan


Displays what Terraform will create â€” good practice before applying.

terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan


Provisions S3, CloudFront, IAM roles, and OAC automatically.

2. Retrieve Website URL
terraform output -raw cloudfront_url


Fetches the live CloudFront URL for the deployed website.

CloudFront may take 2â€“4 minutes to finish global propagation.

3. Destroy Resources (To Free AWS Sandbox Credits)
terraform destroy -auto-approve


Safely removes all deployed AWS resources to stay within sandbox credit limits.

Website Footer Credit

The deployed static site contains this footer for attribution:

Built by Hardik, Andrea, Daniel, Joseph â€” 2025 CCA UG

GitHub Tracking (Optional â€” For Development Logging Only)
./scripts/update-readme-url.sh


Not required for marking â€” used only to log CloudFront URLs during development for tracking.

## AWS Well-Architected Pillar Summary (Quick Justification)

| AWS Pillar | Implementation Insight |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Security** | Private S3 bucket + OAC + HTTPS-only CloudFront |
| **Cost Optimisation** | Serverless static hosting â€” no EC2 or backend costs |
| **Performance Efficiency** | CloudFront global CDN caching reduces latency |
| **Reliability** | Versioned S3 + Terraform IaC = predictable redeployment |
| **Operational Excellence** | Automated deployment with repeatable infrastructure state |
