# Retail E-Commerce Migration (S3 static site)

Deploys a public static website to Amazon S3 using Terraform (AWS Academy Sandbox friendly).

## How to deploy (one person runs)
1) Launch AWS Academy sandbox â†’ Open AWS Console (Sydney).
2) (If using CloudShell) install Terraform or run locally on your laptop.
3) Clone this repo and run:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```
4) Copy the `website_endpoint` from Terraform output and open it in your browser.

## Destroy
```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```

## Notes
- Update `bucket_name_suffix` in `variables.tf` to make the bucket globally unique.
- Keep repo **private**. Never commit secrets or tfstate files.
